# **Software & DevOps Architecture in .NET**
# <sub> Powered by Selenium, CA Principles, TDD, Docker & GitHub Actions </sub>

## Introduction

<strong>This project demonstrates a core foundation for building enterprise web applications with integrated DevOps capabilities.</strong>

Some patterns like DTOs and isolated Use Cases were omitted due to time constraints. I’m archiving it as a structural reference.

This is an evolutionary architecture built with a pragmatic approach; as such, there will never be a 'final' version. I will continue to refine the engineering as time permits and based on the number of stars ⭐ this repository receives.

### Domain

<strong>Contains the core business rules.</strong>

The adoption of DDD principles for this layer is currently being evaluated for a potential update.

### Application

<strong>Defines the application services and coordinates communication between the presentation layer and the business logic.</strong>

The services in this project might be refactored into individual use cases, 
and the whole layer might be refactored with a Vertical-Slice approach in future updates.

### Infrastructure

<strong>Implements technical details such as data access and external services.</strong>

The repositories in this template could be refactored through a generic repository in the future.

### Presentation

<strong>Contains the logic that handles user interaction.</strong>

## DevOps

The repository includes a CI pipeline built with GitHub Actions. This workflow automates test execution and verifies that every change meets the defined standards. The pipeline additionally containerizes the project with Docker and deploys the resulting image to Docker Hub.

## Business Logic

This project emulates an inventory and billing management system.

## Development Approach
The solution follows a TDD-oriented workflow, incorporating unit and integration tests to validate key components and ensure code quality from the early stages of development. In addition, end-to-end tests are implemented using Selenium to verify critical user flows in a real browser environment.

## Runtime Environment
To simplify setup and ensure consistency across environments, the project uses Docker Compose. The configuration includes support for SQL Server, allowing you to easily replicate a realistic database environment for both development and testing.

## YouTube Video
For a short demonstration, I recorded the following video:
